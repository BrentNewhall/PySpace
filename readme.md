# Making a Space Invaders(ish) game in Python, real quick

## Getting Started

Gotta get this thing set up to make a game, and we are going to leverage some tools to make our lives easier.

### What We Need

* Python (obv) 3
* PyGame
* Some pictures/images
* Noises that go boom

Boom, done.

## How we get it

We will be leveraging and online IDE (Integrated Development Environment) called Repl.it.
You don't need to make an account, but feel free to later. This online environment saves us the hassle of worrying about installs and versions.

## What is Python and why is it special

Python is currently a trending language. It has ranked as the most popular programming language in more than one survey. It is the most widely used language for teaching computer science and is the language that people who don't already use it most want to learn.

You'll commonly see Python being used in AI and Machine Learning projects. It's also good for other things too, like games! 

The beauty of Python is that it is a human readable language, which makes it easier for beginners to jump into.
